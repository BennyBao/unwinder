Optimizations:

* Be more aggressive about staying inside the state machine, i.e. use
  "break" instead of "return" when possible (should be able to use
  break almost always except for function calls)

* Reduce function call overhead by not creating a new closure for
  every single function. Coalesce it into just one function (like it
  normally was)
